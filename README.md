# ANN-GWO_MATLAB
Implement intelligent MPPT based on an online optimization technique by Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) to Artificial Neural Network (ANN) called ANN-GWO for a PV modules power plant by MTALB/SIMULINK, the uploaded file is MATLAB Script. The ANN-GWO methodology is designed to enhance the efficiency of the PV system by adapting to varying environmental conditions. Therefore, use these codes for your PV SIMULINK model.
